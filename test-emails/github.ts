<p>Hey Henrique!</p>
<p>I found a little bug in the loading of labels. When emails are fetched in the background, then the label's ThreadList is cleared and needs to be populated again.</p>
<p>Also, during the population of the items, the UI feels pretty sluggish. I've added a video to show it to you:</p>

<p>Humm that's strange... Is it doing a fetch between each (slow) display or are they coming from the same response?</p>
